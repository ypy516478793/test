    "### What is [Incidental Lung Nodule problem](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/incidental-lung-nodules-1)?\n",
    "The risk of developing cancer in very small nodules(<5 mm) is very low. However, clear-cut recommendations are sill not in place with high variation in practice amongst reporting radiologist. As a result, it is common practice to note these nodules in the report and move on, leaving the ball in the clinician's court to decide whether to follow them up and at what interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "> **Develop protocols and tools for using CT (volumetry) of lung nodules as an quantitiative imaging biomarkers of cancer risk.**\n",

    "##### Main idea\n",
    "This paper proposed a 3D deep learning algorithm which utilizes patients' current and prior CT volumns to localize the cancerous nodules and predict the risk of lung cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Problems\n",
    "Lung cancer screening has low sensitivity and specificity performances and has the inter-grader variability problem which will lead to high clinical and financial costs.\n",

    "1. Lung segmentation Mask-RCNN trained on LUNA dataset(TensorFlow Object Detection API), only used to find the lung center for alignment in full volume model.\n",
    "2. Cancer ROI detection using 3D RetinaNet(pretrained first on LIDC then NLST). \n",
    "3. 3D inflated Inception V1 to predict cancer (pretrained on ImageNet, with [Focal Loss](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02002.pdf))  \n",
    "4. Cancer risk prediction model combined both ROIs model(nodule-level local information) and full model(global context ).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Results\n",
    "- When prior CT imaging was not available, proposed model outperformed radiologists with absolute reductions of 11% in FP and 5% in FN. When it is available, model performance was on-par with the radiologists.\n",
    "- Experiments on NLST dataset (86 cancer out of 6,716 cases) achieved AUC-ROC 94.4%.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Take away\n",
    "1. There are estimated **160,000 deaths** in USA in 2018 because of Lung cancer. It is the most common cause of cancer death.\n",
    "2. Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography can reduce mortality by **20-43%**.\n",
    "3. Radiologist workflow:\n",
    "    - full assessment of low-dose CT volume \n",
    "    - focuse on regions of concern\n",
    "    - comparison to prior imaging when available\n",
